# BankTech-Python

Congratulations!

You’ve been chosen as one the latest Technical Contractors for Bank Tech Anywhere Ltd! We’ve heard great things about you! 

You will be responsible for building rapid prototypes of various programs (in Python or C#), fulfilling the needs of different teams across our banking company. The backlog is constantly growing to keep us at the forefront of the industry, so your immediate priorities are outlined below. To deliver maximum value to the business, pick the most challenging problem you think you can tackle over the next hour and see how far you can get! Focus on just one for now. You can always complete more when you’ve finished it. 

Good Luck. We’re counting on you!


1)	Call Centre SPAM
PROBLEM: Our call centres are being inundated with automated SPAM messages from telemarketers. We already have tech that identifies the SPAM numbers and appends “SPAM” to the end of them as strings.

TASK: Write a program that reads each phone number in the sample list below and outputs to the console “OK” for phone numbers that AREN’T labelled as SPAM, or “SPAM” for phone numbers that ARE labelled as SPAM.

SAMPLE DATA: 
<Copy or Read directly from the file in your Visual Studio solution called “PhoneList.txt”>


2)	Keeping Track Of Criminals
PROBLEM: Our criminal investigations unit needs to mark a number of bank notes with the same serial number to track a group of criminals. However, we don’t know how many notes need to be marked, nor what the serial number needs to be yet.

TASK: Write a program that takes two parameters (one number (X), one string) and outputs the string to the console window X number of times.


3)	Cryptographic Primes
PROBLEM: Our security department needs to improve their cryptographic hashing algorithms and need a specific collection of prime numbers for testing. That’s where you come in.

TASK: Create a program that takes two integer parameters (start, end) and prints out all prime numbers in between them.

NOTES: Remember, prime numbers are only divisible by themselves or 1.


4)	Fibonacci Stock Trading
PROBLEM: Our stock traders have managed to break their trading consoles and no longer have access to the fibonacci sequence for their stock charts.

TASK: Create a program that takes two integer parameters (start, X) and then returns X number of fibonacci numbers, starting from (and including) the start number passed.

NOTES: Remember, the fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the fibonacci list of numbers: 
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2


5)	Cashier Console
PROBLEM: Our ATMs (Cash Machines) are down for unscheduled maintenance. We need to give our cashiers a simple solution for updating customer balances interactively (add & subtract amounts). 

TASK: Create an interactive program that takes an initial starting balance (customers have already been verified, so don’t worry about account numbers, etc) and gives our cashiers a simple console UI (User Interface) that asks if they want to add or subtract, before asking for the amount to apply.

NOTES: You might want to consider what could go wrong and account for it in your solution. 
i.e. Negative subtractions, Strings being passed instead of numbers, etc. Can you think of any more?


6)	Web Scraping Spider Bot
PROBLEM: Our market research team have been keeping tabs on some of our competitors, but have accidentally deleted one of their research documents containing some keyword analysis data! Whoops!

TASK: Create a web scraper that takes the sample of website URLs provided and counts how many times each word in the given words list (also provided) occurs. Once you have got that working, re-engineer your solution to follow the first 5 links on the main URL, excluding the page being scraped. Output to the console; the name of the site, followed by the list of words and the frequency at which they appear. If you can break this data down by each link followed, even better.

NOTES: The lists being provided appear in your Visual Studio Solution as: 
-	“WebsiteURLs.txt”
-	“WordsList.txt”


If you get really stuck, don’t be afraid to ask one of our floating Developers to point you in the right direction. Though, they won’t be able to completely solve the tasks for you… that’s YOUR JOB!

Again, Good luck. We know you’ll do great!

Yours sincerely,

Mr. B. Anchor
Chief Technical Officer, Bank Tech Anywhere Ltd.
